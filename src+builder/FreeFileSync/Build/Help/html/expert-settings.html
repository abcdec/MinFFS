	<h1>Expert Settings</h1>

	<p>
		FreeFileSync has a number of special purpose settings that can only be accessed
		directly via the global configuration file <span class="file-path">GlobalSettings.xml</span>.
		Note that this file is read once when FreeFileSync starts and saved when it closes. Therefore apply changes only while FreeFileSync is not running. <br>
		 <br>
		To locate this file on Windows enter <span class="command-line">%appdata%\FreeFileSync</span> in the Windows Explorer address bar or go to the FreeFileSync
		installation folder if you are using the portable installation. 
		On Linux you can find the file in <span class="command-line">~/.FreeFileSync</span> for the Launchpad release and in the installation folder for the portable version. 
		On OS X go to <span class="command-line">~/Library/Application Support/FreeFileSync</span>.

	<p>
		<b>FileTimeTolerance:</b><br>
		By default file modification times
		are allowed to have a 2 second difference while still being
		considered equal. This is required by FAT/FAT32 file systems which
		store file times with a 2 second precision only.<br>This setting
		can also be used to simulate a &quot;compare by file size&quot;,
		ignoring last modification times: 
		Set tolerance to -1 which will be considered as an unlimited file time tolerance.
		Changed files will then be detected as a
		conflict (same date, different file size) and the
		synchronization direction for conflicts can be used accordingly.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>RunWithBackgroundPriority:</b><br>
		While synchronization is running, other applications which are accessing the same
		data locations may experience a noticeable slowdown. Enable this
		setting to lower FreeFileSync's resource consumption at the cost of a
		significantly slower synchronization speed.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>LockDirectoriesDuringSync:</b><br>
		In order to avoid race conditions of multiple FreeFileSync instances
		writing to the same folder at the same time, accesses are serialized
		by lock files (<span class="file-path">sync.ffs_lock</span>).
		This allows to operate FreeFileSync with an arbitrary number of users
		in a network out of the box.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>VerifyCopiedFiles:</b><br>
		If active, FreeFileSync will binary-compare source and target files after
		copying and report verification errors. Note that this may double
		file copy times and is no guarantee that data has not already been
		corrupted prior to copying and corruption is not hidden by
		deceptively reading valid data from various buffers in the
		application and hardware stack.<br>
		<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/19/10350645.aspx">Does
		the CopyFile function verify that the data reached its final destination successfully?</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>LastSyncsLogSizeMax:</b><br>
		The progress logs of the most recent synchronizations (for both GUI and batch jobs) are collected automatically in the file <span class="file-path">LastSyncs.log</span>.
		The maximum size of this log file can be set here.
